# LEGO Price Guessing Quiz

Welcome to the LEGO Price Guessing Quiz! This project aims to challenge what you think you know about the pricing of LEGO sets. Many people believe that LEGO sets are overpriced, but do you really know how much they cost?

## Language

For now the quiz is only available in German.

## Motivation

This project was inspired by the common assumption that LEGO is overpriced. By creating an interactive and engaging way for people to estimate LEGO set prices, this quiz reveals just how off our initial estimates can be.

## Built With

This project is built with Vue 3, and also uses Swiper for the image slideshow, and Underscore.js for array manipulation.

The LEGO data is fetched from a static JSON file which contains real-world LEGO set data.

## Development
